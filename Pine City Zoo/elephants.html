                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Elephants are the largest living land animals. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a
                        trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is prehensile, bringing
                        food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons
                        and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as
                        well as in communication.
                        African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level
                        backs.
                    </p>
                    <p> are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different
                        habitats,
                        including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is
                        accessible.
                        They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion
                        society,
                        in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>Females (cows) tend to live in family groups,
                        which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The leader of a female group,
                        usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.
                        Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males.
                        Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate.
                        They enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other
                        males as well
                        as reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long
                        as three years.
                        Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound;
                        elephants use infrasound and seismic communication over long distances.
                        Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans.
                        They appear to have self-awareness, and possibly show concern for dying and dead individuals of their kind.

                    <p>Here are 5 interesting facts about elephants:
                            1. They are the largest land mammals:
                            Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, with African elephants being the biggest, reaching over 6,000 kg
                            and 3m tall, according to Born Free Foundation www.bornfree.org.uk.
                            2. They have incredible memory:
                            Elephants are known for their extraordinary memory, remembering locations of water sources and food over long
                            distances, even after many years, as noted by Trafalgar Tours.
                            3. They have a long pregnancy:
                            Female elephants have the longest pregnancy of any mammal, lasting a remarkable 22 months, as reported by Action
                            Change.
                            4. They are social animals:
                            Elephants are highly social and live in family groups led by a matriarch, according to Elephant Parade.

                    <p> You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the ampitheatre. </p>
